# Concentrations
This project is used to determine the handedness and gender of an unknown hand given a training set of trace chemicals present on a hand.
This project reads concentrations and does K-Nearest-Neighbors on it to find the most similar examples then classifies and tests how accurate it is if a hand was taken out.
